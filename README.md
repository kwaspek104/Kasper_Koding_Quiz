# Coding_Quiz

## Description 

(This is a project that isn't quite finished yet. But I am going to write about it as if it were done.)

This is a simple coding quiz. This is to test your coding skills and see what you really know! If you get an answer wrong, it will deduct from your timer. It will then display your score (your time) at the end. Then, you can input your initials and save your score! Have fun!
